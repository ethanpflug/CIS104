print("At what size of a project should you start using version management software?")

print("You should start using version management software as soon as you start writing code. This is because it is very important while working in teams, and also has a lot of 
automated features which are important when you write code. Version control software usually includes automated testing, bug fixes, and deployment. There is no real reason 
not to use version control software, since it is so easy to use in today's world. Version control software also helps you reproduce the build you have already created of 
your software. You should use version control software throughout you coding.")
